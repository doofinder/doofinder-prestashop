## 👨‍💻 Development & Maintainer Guide

This repository is optimized for local development using a **Makefile** and **Docker**.

**`.env`** sits at the repo root and powers both your **Docker** stack and the **generated module files** (what `doofinder-configure` pulls from `templates/`). It ships with sensible defaults—skim it, adjust shop URL, PrestaShop tag, and plugin version, then `make init`. Optional overrides go in **`.env.local`**, which loads on top of `.env`.

> [!NOTE]
> `make doofinder-configure` generates the plugin files from the `templates/` directory (using `.env`) and runs `make dump-autoload` to regenerate the Composer autoloader. Many other targets depend on it, so running those targets keeps generated files in sync.

### Environment and shop access

The root **`.env`** lists all variables with comments. For the **dev stack**, these are the ones you usually touch first:

| Variable | Role |
| -------- | ---- |
| `BASE_URL` | Shop hostname as seen by Docker (no `https://`). |
| `PRESTASHOP_DOCKER_TAG` | PrestaShop image/version used by the stack. |
| `MYSQL_*` | Database for the local shop. |
| `PS_*` | Installer options (language, country, domain, SSL, etc.). |
| `PS_ADMIN_EMAIL` / `PS_ADMIN_PASSWORD` | Back-office login after install. |
| `PS_FOLDER_ADMIN` | URL segment for the admin (see **Default access** below). |

**Default access (Docker dev stack):** After **`make init`**, open the shop using the host ports from **`docker-compose.yml`** (stock mapping: **9011** → HTTP, **4011** → HTTPS on the container). With the default **`BASE_URL=localhost`** and **`PS_FOLDER_ADMIN=4dm1n`** from `.env`, typical URLs are:

| | URL |
| -- | -- |
| Storefront (HTTP) | `http://localhost:9011/` |
| Storefront (HTTPS) | `https://localhost:4011/` |
| Back office (HTTP) | `http://localhost:9011/4dm1n` |
| Back office (HTTPS) | `https://localhost:4011/4dm1n` |

Back-office login is **`PS_ADMIN_EMAIL`** / **`PS_ADMIN_PASSWORD`** in `.env` (stock file uses `test@example.com` / `admin123`—change these for anything beyond local-only use). **`make init`** prints usable links; if you change ports or `BASE_URL`, adjust accordingly.

**Use cases:**

- **First-time setup:** Run `make init` once to build images, install PrestaShop, and start containers.
- **Install the Doofinder module:** after `make init`, follow the [installation guide](https://support.doofinder.com/plugins/prestashop/installation-guide/installation-steps-prestashop). Alternatively, use `make doofinder-upgrade` from the CLI.
- **Start / stop the stack:** `make start`, `make stop`.
- **Uninstall the module:** `make doofinder-uninstall`.
- **Reinstall the module:** `make doofinder-reinstall`.
- **DB snapshot:** `make db-backup` (optionally `make db-backup prefix=_name`). Restore with `make db-restore file=backup.sql.gz`.
- **Clear cache:** `make cache-flush`.
- **Shell in the web container:** `make dev-console`.
- **Start from scratch:** Run `make clean` to drop Docker volumes and `./html`; type `DELETE` when prompted, then run `make init` for a fresh PrestaShop.
- **Debug with Xdebug:** The stack already enables Xdebug in Docker. Set `XDEBUG_HOST` and `XDEBUG_KEY` in `.env` or `.env.local` (e.g. `host.docker.internal` on Docker Desktop, your host IP on Linux), use the same key in your IDE, listen for connections, and browse the shop.

## Compatibility Matrix

We test against a wide range of PrestaShop and PHP combinations to ensure stability.
Example combinations from [PrestaShop Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/prestashop/prestashop/tags):

| PrestaShop | PHP                     |
| ---------- | ----------------------- |
| 8.2.1      | 8.1, 8.0, 7.4, 7.3, 7.2 |
| 8.1.7      | 8.1, 8.0, 7.4, 7.3, 7.2 |
| 8.0.5      | 8.1, 8.0, 7.4, 7.3, 7.2 |
| 1.7.8.9    | 7.4, 7.3, 7.2, 7.1      |
| 1.6        | 7.2, 7.1, 7.0, 5.6      |
| 1.5[^ps15] | 7.2, 7.1, 7.0, 5.6, 5.5 |

[^ps15]: PrestaShop 1.5: patched for auto installation (see Dockerfile). Use MySQL 5.5 and without SSL.

Set `PRESTASHOP_DOCKER_TAG` in the `.env` file and (if needed) PHP version in your Docker build args when using these combinations.
